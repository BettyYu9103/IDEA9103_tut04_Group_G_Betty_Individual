Intruduction:
- Move the mouse over the canvas.
- When the mouse is touching a wheel, the wheel starts to rotate, the ellipses inside the wheel and beads around the wheel become squares.
- When the mouse leaves the wheel, the wheel graduatly stop rotating and all squares turn back to ellipses.

Details:
- I choose Time-Based.
- All my animation will be related with mouse monitoring. 
- I got inspiration from pixel game like Stardew Valley. However, turning all shapes into pixel style would change too many group codes. The main style would also change. So, I only changed the easiest shape, ellipse.
